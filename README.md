# Data Analysis of "albums.csv" in R

In this project, an analysis is performed on the dataframe = “album”. 

The ‘album’ dataframe consists of the genre, artist, and album information (year and title). Each album contains multiple genres. For easier data management, an ‘album_all’ dataframe was created using Excel Power Query, where each genre is placed in a separate column.
